Do you not know what a CTF even is? (Competitions in security). Then this event is for you! Together with Chalmers CTF team we will have a evening filled to the brim with all that have to do with CTFs!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will have the chance to get help to set up OWASP JuiceShop, look at common tools used in different CTFs and how to continue on after this event with playing CTFs. And the main piece of the evening will be our very own CTF (built by Chalmers CTF and OWASP) with prizes on the line!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to our sponsor, &lt;a href="https://kits.se"&gt;KITS&lt;/a&gt;, there will be a bit bigger main prize but also food and refreshments during the evening! (This event will be alcohol-free!)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a event aimed towards beginners! We do not discourage people that have played before to attend but we will start from the very beginning and work our way up!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The event will be kept at Chalmers in a workshop-style. So bring your own laptop! Internet will be provided!
Those that want to prepare can install and make sure Docker works on their machines (if interested in running the OWASP JuiceShop or similar locally on your machine)

&lt;br /&gt;
Great! Then you will be happy to hear that we are going to apply to become an official student association under the student union. With that comes a lot of new oppertunites and potential to grow! Both for you and the group!
&lt;br /&gt;
We will have a meeting on the 27th of April where Staff will present exactly what we have done during our time at the helm, where we would want to go in the future (including the upcoming events we have planned before summer), what support is given and what is to be expected of you if you take over. Then we also will have a open discussion! We are the sum of our parts so of course we want to hear from our memebers! Even if you are not interested in joining in an official fashion we would love to hear from you! So drop by!&lt;br&gt;

It will start with a short introduction about what is a CTF, what different forms are there and why do we play.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It will follow with a live demo how to get started with some of the beginner resources but also a intermediate resource for those that are ready to move along.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the introduction and demo we will split into groups based on what you want to learn and your current skill to get started with some more hands on experience with the resources presented.

We will set up at 17:15 and prepare, so you are welcome by then already to ask questions or just hang out to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
