Hey everybody!  
<br />
This Saturday (2017-03-18) we will meet at Chalmers and play the 0CTF together. We plan on playing this to the end and hopefully going to China to qualify for DEF CON CTF 2017.
<br /><br />
Some information from the organisers:
<br />

>Top 12 teams in 0CTF Quals will be qualified for the Final round, which will be held in Shenzhen, China during the early weeks of June.
>The champion of 0CTF Finals will be qualified for DEF CON 25 CTF!  
><br />
>We will partly cover the accommodation and transportation fees for the qualified teams.


### Time and place:
We will meet at the EA lecture room at Chalmers 11:00. Bring your computers and if you have any power extensions, bring those too. During the breaks we can together get some food and recharge our batteries.
<br /><br />
The CTF goes on for 48 hours and begins 01:00 on Saturday and ends on Monday 01:00.
<br /><br />
You are welcome to join and play for as long as you want, if this is the first CTF you will play don't fear anything! We will work with you and guide you through the challenges so you get the chance to submit some flags ;) At the end of the day, we are all students and we are all learning as we play!
<br /><br />
Join us this Saturday and together we can get some flags!!
